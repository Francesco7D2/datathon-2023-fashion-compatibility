# Datathon 2023 UPC MANGO

## Introduction

The main goal of this challenge is to build a model capable of creating several outfits given a single piece of clothing as input.

## Key Points
To achieve our solution, we explored several approaches. One involved filling in the blanks by grouping the data by outfits and attempting to predict the missing product given the features of this outfit and the products -1. However, this approach proved to be highly time-consuming. Therefore, we considered a different approach by rearranging the data as shown in the image below. We then experimented with both neural network and Random Forest Regression for the prediction process.

## Results
By readjusting the conditions to build an outfit, we were able to establish effective rules for creating stylish outfits, as illustrated below.

## Code
For a detailed understanding of our methodology and implementation, we welcome any feedback or suggestions.

## DEMO
Once we trained our model, we can reuse the model to predict the outfit given an initial product, as demonstrated in the image below.
